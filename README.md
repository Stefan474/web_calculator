# web_calculator

Last web dev 101 project from The Odin Project. 

Everything felt really easy to make, and I had no issues making the app, but I definitely feel that if I could rewrite it right now, it would turn out a lot cleaner than it is right now. 

Overall though, I am pretty satisfied, it works!
